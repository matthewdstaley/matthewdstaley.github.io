I have studied and taught mathematics for the last ten years. I am starting my transition into the tech community here in the bay area. I currently reside in San Francisco, CA.

[My Resume]( /assets/resume.pdf )


I am a long time guitar player and jazz musician. I hope you can enjoy some of my music [here][jekyll] on sound cloud.

Other hobbies include photography, hiking and surfing.
