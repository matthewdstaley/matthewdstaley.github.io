I currently reside in San Francisco, CA. I recently finished grad school at San Francisco State University. I studied and taught mathematics for the last ten years. I am ready to move on from the academic world.

I am also a long time guitar player and jazz musician. I hope you can enjoy some of my music [here][jekyll] on sound cloud.

Other hobbies include [photography][jekyll-1], hiking and surfing.
